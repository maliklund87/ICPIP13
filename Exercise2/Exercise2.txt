*  Texturing

   Look at the example in the Texture Folder.

   Add textures and lights to objects created in the exercises.

   To load textures the most simple way is to use "RAW" format.
   

** Converting to RAW
   convert images using GIMP
   or ImageMagicks  "convert"
   $ convert input rgb:output.raw
   you can add the "depth" and "size" options too


* Shading
  Look at the example in the phong folder.

  Make sure you understand what is happening.

  Change the shader such that the calculations are per-fragment and
  not per vertex.

** Hints and such

   It is possible to reload the shader on runtime. This way you do not
   have to restart or recompile you program every time you make a
   small change in the shader.

   You can press 'r' to reload. There is no error handling or
   fallback, so if compilation fails you have to restart the program.

   In the code there is specified a varying parameter, the normal. A
   technique often used to debug shaders and graphics code is to write
   the data the output. You can try to see what the varying normal vector
   looks like interpreted as a color.
