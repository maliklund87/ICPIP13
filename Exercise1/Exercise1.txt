* Your task is
  Understand the example

  - try changing the order of the transformations.
  - try changing the scene graph, what happens if the earth orbits mars?
  
* Implement your own scene using the scenegraph
  You are free to implement your own more complex scenegraph,
  also in C++.


* Implement reverse traversal
  That is, extend the nodes with a parent and set the parent
  when adding a child
  Implement a function concatenating the transformations from
  any node to the root, perhaps
  f4x4 frame−to−canonical(node ∗n);
  Make sure to compose transformations in correct order!
  Use the node to root traversal to calculate Fcam
  i.e. place a camera anywhere in the scene.
